# CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship Tasks  

ðŸ“Œ This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **C++ Programming Internship at CodeAlpha (Septâ€“Oct 2025)**.  
The projects focus on applying **core C++ concepts** to solve real-world problems, improve coding efficiency, and strengthen problem-solving skills.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features & Learning Outcomes  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Arrays, linked lists, recursion, sorting, searching, backtracking.  
- **STL (Standard Template Library):** Vectors, maps, sets, algorithms, iterators.  
- **File Handling:** Storing and retrieving data (e.g., login credentials, transaction history).  
- **Problem-Solving:** Writing efficient, optimized, and clean C++ code.
